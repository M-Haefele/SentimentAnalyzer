"So do we do?

If facilities are your #1 concern, short term we need to shift Congress’ knee-jerk addiction to funding carceral facilities (ICE/CBP) to expansion of ORR (office of refugee resettlement) and HHS (health and human services).

But that’s not a long term solution."
"Fact is a lot of the politicians crying right now don’t work to solve either.

They vote to grow ICE + CBP cages and they do everything to avoid addressing the root: US foreign policy and interventionism that destabilizes regions, the climate crisis, and unjust economic policy."
"Politicians and pundits who are pretending to care about the border now but have continuously voted to expand these cages can sit down.

You might be new to this, but we’re true to this.

Short-term issue is facilities. Long-term issue is destabilization that’s driving migration."
"For all the new tears GOP have about the border, what are their policy solutions? A Muslim ban, racist policy, shutting down the border, &amp; more cages.

If you don’t want children in cages, then you need to stop upholding CBP, ICE, and the military as the solution to this crisis."
"For all those who are brand new to this &amp; only care about cages on a partisan basis, catch up: we‘ve been fighting our own party on immigration for a long time.

This is the result of Congress endlessly dumping money into CBP/ICE cages vs humane policy

It also appears that some of Amazon's anti-union efforts may have been in violation of NLRB law. And that is something that the union is addressing with the NLRB right now.
"I am disappointed but not surprised by the vote. It is extraordinarily courageous for workers to take on one of the world's wealthiest and most powerful corporations, a company that spent unlimited sums of money to defeat the organizing effort."

Cost of prescription eyeglasses: Over $200

Median income of seniors: About $2,200 a month

In the richest country on earth, we must expand Medicare to include vision, hearing and dental care."
Let's be clear: 70% of tipped workers are women. We will not have equal pay for equal work until we increase the $2.13 sub-minimum wage - which has not gone up in 30 years - to $15 an hour and adopt one fair wage. We must end the crisis of starvation wages in America. https://t.co/fIGfoGg3Nq

According to a recent Gallup poll:

– 60% want to expand Medicare to all

Health care is a human right, not a privilege."
"In the richest country on earth it's absurd that 75% of seniors who need hearing aids don't have one, 65% of seniors don't have dental insurance &amp; eyeglass frames manufactured for as little as $10 cost over $230. We must expand Medicare to cover hearing, vision &amp; dental care."
"Maybe it's a radical idea in Washington, but no. I do not believe that the billionaire class should pay a lower effective tax rate than the middle class. A profitable corporation like Zoom should not be able to pay nothing in federal income taxes when its profits go up by 4,000%."
Life expectancy for low-income Americans is right now about 15 years lower than for the wealthy. Poverty in the richest country in the history of the world is a death sentence.
"Since 1985, the average Wall Street bonus has gone up 1,217%. If the federal minimum wage had increased at the same rate as Wall Street bonuses, it would be $44/hour. Instead, it's remained stuck at $7.25 an hour for 12 years. We must raise the minimum wage to at least $15/hour."
"There are millions of seniors who cannot afford dental care, hearing aids or eyeglasses. In the richest country on earth that is unacceptable. That is why Medicare must negotiate drug prices and use the savings to expand Medicare to cover these basic health care needs."
